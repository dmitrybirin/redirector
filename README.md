# redirector
Simple chrome extension to redirect from a list of silly sites to more educational ones.
for now get redirect rules from a hardcoded list

##ToDo:
0. Revisit the redirect mechanism
1. Make possible to change redirect rules list through interface
2. Add sites with "+" from the extension, when at the site 
3. Redirect to one static site, like https://www.gofuckingwork.com?
4. Create less abusive site, more funny meditational one?)
